# Facebook-Stock-Prediction-Model
I am excited to share that I have successfully completed a fascinating project where I used machine learning algorithms to create a model to predict Facebook's stock prices!

This project highlights the potential of machine learning in financial forecasting. The goal of this project was to create a machine learning model to predict Facebook's stock price for the next 'n' days, where 'n' is set to 30 in this case. I utilized two powerful machine learning models for this task: Linear Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM). 
The project highlight is as follows: 
Train-Test Split: The data was divided into an 80:20 ratio for training and testing to ensure a robust evaluation.
Cross-Validation: The models were validated using RÂ² values to determine their predictive power and accuracy.
Prediction: Linear Regression & SVM learning algorithms were used for prediction. Achieved reliable predictions for the next 30 days.
